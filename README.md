Hello all! SEngine was an exploratory project that I did from roughly January 2021 to January 2022. I stopped for many reasons including:
1.)Impending job
2.)Development hell
3.)Product was too technical for target market, couldn't justify its existence to myself
4.)General fatigue

Please be my guest and look thru all of my commits. This project, like many of my other ones is largely exploratory. I went thru it being a backend app, then a frontend app, then a downloadable app(this is put as simply as possible, the process had many iterations of each and at some points bled into each other).

this taught me/improved my skills in:

-react
-node frameworks
-aws services
-wasm
-electron
-many more fine technologies which would waste your time to enumerate
