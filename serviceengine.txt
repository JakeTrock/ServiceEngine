A service engine is a web-based alternative to the core of an operating system, it performs single tasks based on natural instructions rather than using a whole application.

could be created with a web vm running in js or with wasm, or with a server api and desktop application

"piping" will be done with x then y, so to take a picture then crop it, you would say "take a picture then crop it"

* denotes a core feature
