A service engine is a web-based alternative to the core of an operating system, it performs single tasks based on natural instructions rather than using a whole application.

could be created with a web vm running in js or with wasm, or with a server api and desktop application

"piping" will be done with x then y, so to take a picture then crop it, you would say "take a picture then crop it"

        Sengine will be a web-based OS with a messenger like ferdi, and a dropdown function bar that'll act like the current sengine box. If you want to use a service for an extended duration, you can pop it out of the hovering search dialouge.
