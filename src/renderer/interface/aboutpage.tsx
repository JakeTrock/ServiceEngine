                The internet is a trove of tools, but many of these tools have
                been plagued by a recurring set of issues, namely, them being
                ad-infested, slow, buggy, non-intuitive, a security risk and
                myriad other issues.

                SEngine's here to fix that.
              </h4>
              <br />
              We are building a platform on the cutting-edge WASM language that
              is being adopted by browsers to deliver secure, intuitive client
              side applications.
              <br />
              SEngine is still in development, but when finished, its interface
              builder and wasm compiler will allow you to cobble together a gui
              that will work on the majority of browsers, and write a script to
              power it in an intuitive language, all in a fraction in the time
              it'd take you to write it from scratch. Then you'll be able to
              share it to our community. We want to foster a two-way
              relationship between developers and nonprogrammers that will
              finally bridge the productivity gap between those that know and
              those that don't.
              <br />
              You'll also be able to share settings within it so when a friend
              asks "how do I make a video slideshow of my trip from these
              photos?", you'll go from a grueling 2 hour video help call to a
              "try this".
